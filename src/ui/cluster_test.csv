3,Vegemite Sandwich Tradional (Veggie Sanger),501850,"I can't believe a traditional &quot;Veggie Sanger&quot; has not been posted!
&quot;No Worries Mate&quot;................ I am here to fix that!
Vegemite sandwiches are terrific for school lunches, and used to be an Aussie Tradition, not so long ago but not so sure about now. 
Vegemite is high in Vitamin B .....but it is quite salty so it probably not considered a health food as such because of the saltiness. But they do not go soggy like a lot of sandwich's do at school!
A Vegemite sandwich is a quick and easy snack for both kids and adults. All you will need is bread and butter or margarine .......and of course that jar of black gold &quot;Vegemite! &quot;
Of course you can add things if you prefer, like cheese or avocado!
Even use crumpets instead of bread, for an amazing snack.
Come be an &quot;Happy Little Vegemite!&quot;","butter, vegemite",10,c2

15,Healing Lotion Butters With Emu,316855,"This healing lotion is wonderful on the skin....used on a regular base, your skin will love you.  I love Emu oil for its healing components, but it is quite a pricy oil.  Because this lotion is a butter, a little goes a long way.  Use on your feet and wrap them up in plastic for the oil to absorb into the feet.  Perfect on hands, lips....any where extra attention is needed.  I found it a little to heavy on the face in the summer....but have used it in the winter time when the weather changes and you need that extra moisture.  My nose cracks and dries during allergy season and in the wintertime...so using this lotion has been the perfect solution.

It's really just a different way of making the grilled cheese that we all know and love, but in miniature it is just SO cute. I served these at my daughter's first birthday party.

19,Aunt Sophie's,423267,"This is a super simple potato dish that came from my husband's family.  He says there has never been an Aunt Sophie in the family, but this dish was a family favorite.  I never measure what I put into it, but it is so simple, it would be hard to mess up.  Prep time includes peeling the potatoes and sweating the onions, but not necessarily boiling the potatoes. Note: I find it easier to peel the potatoes after boiling them - the skins come right off when you rub them with your hands.","potatoes, onion, butter",11,c2

It is prepared in the microwave. 4 Tbl of mix filled my mug about half full, it does rise a little when cooking. This amount of mix will make 11 cakes, or if your mug is big enough for a double batch it will make 5. If you just want to make one just decrease the yield to 1 cake.
